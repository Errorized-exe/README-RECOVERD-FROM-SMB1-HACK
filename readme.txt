Yuuwan's Custom Hack Mario "Fruit Punch"
Release Date: 2004/8/13

This is a Mario hack with only 1-1 (a one-stage event). 
It uses one known glitch (a trick popular in Mario 2 back in the day). 
Once you know the method, anyone can clear it easily.

The title "Fruit Punch" has two meanings: 
1. It uses multiple support patches mixed together. 
2. You'll understand the second meaning when you play.

Support patches used:
- MHS's Upside-Down Pipe Patch
- Nanakyu's Spike Patch
- Waiwai's Air Consecutive Jump Patch (no longer distributed)

Enjoy playing!
